# SmokeAlert: Arduino-Based Smoke Detection System

## Overview
**SmokeAlert** is an integrated smoke detection system designed to enhance fire safety in homes, schools, and workplaces. It combines **hardware and software** to provide **real-time smoke detection, smoke-level monitoring, threshold adjustment, and audible/visual alerts**. The system uses an **MQ-2 gas sensor** to detect smoke and combustible gases, while an **Arduino Uno** microcontroller processes the data and controls outputs.  

This project improves traditional smoke detectors by offering **faster alerts, customizable thresholds, and energy-efficient monitoring**, helping to prevent fire incidents and protect lives and property.

## Features
- **Real-Time Smoke Detection:** Instant detection of smoke and combustible gases.  
- **Smoke-Level Monitoring:** Continuously measures smoke concentration and outputs analog readings.  
- **Threshold Modification:** Users can set or modify the trigger threshold to reduce false alarms.  
- **Audible and Visual Alerts:** LED and buzzer alert occupants when dangerous smoke levels are detected.  
- **Power Consumption Monitoring:** Estimates power usage to ensure energy-efficient operation.  
- **Event Logging:** Serial monitor displays real-time readings and event logs for monitoring and analysis.
